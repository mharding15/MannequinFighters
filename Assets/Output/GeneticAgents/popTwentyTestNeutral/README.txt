This is the first long test that I did. The training is being done by the characters fight both the player before and after them (decided randomly) and then adding the fitnesses from both matches to be the final fitness for the player (tree). The fitness function is just the health differential - the treeDepthFactor (which I'm thinking about removing or nerfing, I don't know if I want this to be the only thing used they are going off of if there is no damage dealt).
